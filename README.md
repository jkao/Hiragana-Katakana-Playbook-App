Playbook HTML5 Hiragana-Katakana Trainer
---
* Built for Playbook developer program (free Playbook!)
* Uses Backbone.js and Foundation, so it's a good demo for people
  wanting to learn.
* Try it out with different screen sizes, it'll adjust! However, it's
  forced landscape on the PlayBook since it looks better that way ;)
* Many more possible future features, feel free to fork!

TODO:
---
* Minify and group together assets
* Refactor code (see comments)
* Add cool new features!
